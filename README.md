I am **ShivaSankar**, a PhD student at Hokkaido University, Japan doing research in intersections of Theoretical particle physics, Cosmology and Astrophysics. 

ðŸ”¬ My main topics of research include:

- Neutrinos, Dark matter, Other new physics beyond Standard model
- Black hole physics, Supernovas, Gravitational wave physics
- Deep reinforcement learning

I love coding, especially automating tasks and building solutions that make life easier. What truly drives me is creating tools and applications that can positively impact others' lives. I'm particularly passionate about Deep Reinforcement Learning and am currently working on projects in this topic and learning it. There's something deeply satisfying about transforming ideas into practical solutions that solve real-world problems

My hobby in short is learning, I love learning new skills and learning new knowledge and connecting the dots. Therefore I have too many hobbies to list down here, some of the recent ones include, Cubing, Coding, Piano, Photography & Cinematography, Language learning etc.

ðŸ”­ Currently I am splitting my time working on the following coding projects and learning the Mojo Programming language,
- [NuMojo](https://github.com/shivasankarka/NuMojo) - NuMojo is a numerics library written in native Mojo in the likes of NumPy, SciPy from Python.
- [HEPJo](https://github.com/shivasankarka/HEPJo) - HEPJo is a math library for doing data analysis and computations in High Energy Physics a.k.a Particle Physics.
- [DRL: Tic Tac Toe through MCTS](https://github.com/shivasankarka/RL-Rubiks-TicTacToe) - Exploring reinforcement and deep learning through projects like training an MCTS-driven neural network to master Tic-Tac-Toe inspired by AlphaZero.
- [ML Algorithms](https://github.com/shivasankarka/MLAlgorithms) - Implementing ML algorithms with NuMojo to learn the fundamental of ML algorithsm and improve NuMojo library. 

ðŸ’¬ If you would like to talk to me about anything, please drop me a message at my email. Feel free to check my webpage and my Research profile at,
