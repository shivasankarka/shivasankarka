I am ShivaSankar, a Physics Graduate student at Hokkaido University, Japan doing research in intersections of Theoretical particle physics, Cosmology and Astrophysics. 

My main topics of research include:

- Neutrinos, Dark matter, Higgs, Extra gauge bosons
- Black hole physics, Supernovas etc
- Deep reinforcement learning

My hobby in short is learning, I love learning new skills and learning new knowledge and connecting the dots. Therefore I have too many hobbies to list down here, some of the recent ones include, Cubing, Coding, Piano, Photography & Cinematography, Language learning etc.

I love coding, especially to automate things and build stuff that makes my life easier. I love the field of Deep Reinforcement learning and I am working on few projects of my own, I will make a repo once I am done. 

ðŸ”­ Currently I am splitting my time working on the following coding projects and learning the Mojo Programming language,
- [NuMojo](https://github.com/shivasankarka/NuMojo) - NuMojo is a numerics library written in native Mojo in the likes of NumPy, SciPy from Python.
- [HEPJo](https://github.com/shivasankarka/HEPJo) - HEPJo is a math library for doing data analysis and computations in High Energy Physics a.k.a Particle Physics.

If you would like to talk to me about anything, please drop me a message at my email. Feel free to check my webpage and my Research profile at,
